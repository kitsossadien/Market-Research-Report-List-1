<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic Proportional Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-acting Type</li><li>Pilot-operated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electromagnetic proportional valve market is segmented into two primary types: direct-acting and pilot-operated valves. Direct-acting valves respond directly to electrical signals, controlling flow or pressure with high precision in smaller applications. In contrast, pilot-operated valves utilize a smaller pilot valve to control a larger main valve, allowing for greater flow capacity and power efficiency, suitable for larger systems. Both types are crucial for applications requiring precise fluid control in various industries like manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace.</p></p>
