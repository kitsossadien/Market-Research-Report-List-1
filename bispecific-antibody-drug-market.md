<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bispecific Antibody Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fragment-Based</li><li>IgG-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bispecific antibody drug market is divided into two main types: fragment-based and IgG-based. Fragment-based bispecific antibodies utilize smaller molecular fragments, such as single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), allowing for greater tissue penetration and flexibility in targeting two distinct antigens simultaneously. In contrast, IgG-based bispecific antibodies maintain the structural integrity of IgG molecules, promoting improved stability and longer half-lives in circulation. Both types offer unique advantages, enhancing therapeutic efficacy in conditions like cancer and autoimmune diseases.</p></p>
